Core Concepts of a Taipy Application are as follows:


-> This is the core class responsible for creating and running the graphical user interface.
-> A string containing the content to be displayed, usually written in Markdown or HTML.
-> This allows dynamic linking of Python variables to the GUI components for real-time updates.
-> These are predefined UI elements like buttons, sliders, charts, etc., that can be easily added to the GUI.
-> Functions that are triggered by user interactions with the GUI elements.
-> The run() method of the Gui class starts the Taipy server and renders the application.
-> Styles and layouts can be customized using CSS and additional HTML for advanced designs.
-> Taipy easily integrates with other Python libraries and tools for enhanced functionality.

Structure of a Taipy Application are as follows:

-> Import the Gui class from the Taipy library.
-> Create a string variable containing the content to be displayed.
-> Instantiate the Gui class with the page content.
-> Call the run() method on the Gui instance to start the application.
